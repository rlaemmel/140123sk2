Find the two palindroms times (e.g., 00:00 or 10:01) during the day with the biggest min diff. We simplify the algorithm a bit by not considering the diff between the last palindrom time of the day and the first palindrom time of the next day.

It happens that the solution is ambigious:

* 05:50 -- 10:01
* 15:51 -- 20:02
